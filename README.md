# Forecasts-for-airline-fares
This Tableau visualization project aims to provide insights into airline fare trends and forecast future fares based on historical data. The project utilizes various data sources and employs forecasting techniques to predict fare prices for different routes and airlines.
## Forecasting Methodology

The forecasting methodology employed in this project involves the following steps:

1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: The raw data from various sources is cleaned, merged, and preprocessed to ensure consistency and compatibility.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Thorough EDA is performed to identify patterns, trends, and potential factors influencing airline fares.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Relevant features are engineered from the available data to enhance the predictive power of the forecasting models.
4. **Time Series Analysis**: Time series analysis techniques, such as decomposition, autocorrelation, and stationarity checks, are applied to understand the underlying patterns in the fare data.
5. **Model Selection and Training**: Various forecasting models, such as ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, and Prophet, are evaluated, and the most suitable model is selected based on performance metrics.
6. **Forecasting**: The trained model is used to forecast future airline fares for different routes and airlines.

## Visualization and Reporting

The forecasted airline fares and related insights are visualized using Tableau. The visualizations include:

- **Interactive Dashboard**: An interactive dashboard that allows users to explore fare forecasts for different routes, airlines, and time periods.
- **Time Series Visualizations**: Visual representations of historical fare data, forecasted values, and confidence intervals.
- **Geographical Visualizations**: Maps and charts displaying fare trends across different regions and airports.
- **Scenario Analysis**: Interactive visualizations to analyze the impact of various factors, such as fuel prices, economic conditions, and seasonal trends, on fare forecasts.
